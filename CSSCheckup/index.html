    <p>This is a dotted border that I have been stuck on for 2 days. Why does it work now? No idea :)</p>

    <div class="background">
        <p>Honestly, I wrote the code and it didn't work. I rewrote the code. It didn't work. I compared it to the original example in the module. It looked the same. I deleted everything and copied over the module code. It worked. I deleted everything and wrote the code again, compared it, and it worked. What did I do different?</p>
