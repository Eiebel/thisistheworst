    <h1>Things that I see in my yard</h1>

    <h3>It's a long list so I will be short</h3>

    <ul>Grass</ul>
    <ul>trash</ul>
    <ul>Some random cat</ul>
    <ul>Some trees</ul>
    <ul>Dog poop</ul>
    <ul>A camper</ul>
    
    <p>My yard may sound gross, but mostly it is due to laziness and my dog's incessent need to poop. When she was a puppy she learned to go to the bathroom next to the toilet because she saw humans do it and wanted to copy them. I later hired a dog trainer to teach me how to show her how to use the toilet but the trainer said I would need to build a big platform, always leave the lid up and that it would cost several thousand dollars in trainging. So I digressed, much like this train of thought...</p>

    <h3>So then I wanted to create a list of how I could make my yard look better...</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>I could mow.</li>
        <li>And pick up the poop.</li>
        <li>Maybe clean up the trash and by trash I mean scraps of wood from the various projects I do on the house</li>
        <li>Maybe finish the retaining wall I started?</li>
    </ol>

 <h4>Anyway, I digress again. Some say I have ADHD.</h4>

    <h2>Oh, there are also this thing!</h2>
